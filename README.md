# Push_swap - 42 Network Project

Push_swap is a project from the 42 Network focused on sorting a stack of integers using a limited set of operations. The challenge is to optimize the algorithm to minimize the number of operations, reinforcing knowledge of sorting algorithms, data structures, and performance optimization.

üöÄ **Features**  
- Sorts a stack of integers using basic operations like `sa`, `sb`, `pa`, `pb`, `ra`, `rb`, `rra`, and `rrb`.  
- Focuses on algorithm optimization to minimize operation count.  
- Reinforces understanding of stack data structures and efficient sorting techniques.  

üõ†Ô∏è **Getting Started**

**Prerequisites**  
To get started, ensure you have the following installed:
- A C compiler like `gcc` or `clang`
- `make` for building the project
- A UNIX-like operating system (Linux/macOS/WSL)
